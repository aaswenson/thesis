\section{Introduction}
Long-lifetime, reliable electricity sources will be vital a vital engineering
component of future long-term space missions. Nuclear energy systems are
promising in their ability to deliver large amounts of electricity for long
mission timelines. Traditionally, radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs)
have been used to provide electrical power for deep space missions. Planned
future space missions such as a manned mission to Mars will require much more
power than RTGs currently provide. This work investigates the feasibility of a
fission power system driving a Supercritical CO2 Brayton Cycle to provide power
to support a long-term space mission.
