\chapter{Coolant Property Plots}\label{ch:appendix-b}

These property plots were generated using EES. They are used by the reactor mass
model to get secondary transport properties as a function of bulk temperature
and pressure. Pressure was relatively unimportant for \codiox properties,
except for density. The \water properties had a stronger response to pressure.
Two dimensional linear interpolation was used to estimate values in between
EES-modeled points. This was a good estimation, as shown in the following
property plots.
