\section{Reactor Design Verification}
    As discussed earlier, the scope of this project was not to develop a mature
reactor concept. Most of this work focused on modeling the mass of the
reactor as a function of flow inputs and thermal power requirements. It is
prudent however, to verify that the chosen reactor design is feasible as a
reactor concept. The purpose of this section is to convince the reader that
the chosen reactor design is valid, and with significant engineering effort,
could be developed into a working nuclear reactor. To this end, more detailed
neutronics modeling was performed on the chosen reactor design.
