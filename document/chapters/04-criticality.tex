\section{Critical Core Radius}

The conclusion of the neutronics parameter sweeps is that EOL \keff is only
strongly dependent on \uran mass in a core. It follows that a critical core
constraint can be imposed on the thermal hydraulic equations in section to
determine the required radius of a reactor given a fuel fraction. For each
reactor design, a critical radius curve was produced to support modeling of a
critical, coolable reactor mass. The critical radius curves were produced using
homogeneous MCNP6.1 models of the reactor \citep{MCNP_citation}.
