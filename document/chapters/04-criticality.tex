\chapter{Critical Core Constraint}\label{ch:crit_radius}
The critical core constraint was developed to ensure coolable reactors were also
neutronically valid. In Chapter \ref{ch:sweeps} it was deemed sufficient to
constrain the core neutronics with BOL excess reactivity. Three parameters were
chosen to model reactivity: core radius, fuel fraction, and enrichment.
Enrichment was fixed to 93\% in order to maximize \uran concentration in the
fuel. Core radius and fuel fraction were used to constrain the core geometry to
a target excess reactivity. Reflector thickness was added in this Chapter to
minimize the constrained reactor mass.

\section{Modeling Techniques}
There were three major steps to developing the critical core radius
constraints. The first component was determining a value for BOL excess
reactivity that would ensure sufficient EOL reactivity (\keff > 1.0).
The second step was generating the relationship between core radius, fuel
fraction, reflector multiplier, and \keff in order to constrain the model to a
target \keff. Finally, for each fuel fraction, a constrained optimization was
performed using reflector multiplier to minimize the reactor mass. The result of
this optimization was a mass-minimized relationship between core radius and fuel
fraction. 

This process will be described in full for a single reactor core (\uox-\codiox). The process
was performed for additional combinations of coolants and fuels and in theory,
could be applied to future reactor concepts. Initially, the \uox-\codiox and the
UW-\codiox reactors were used to develop the model. One of the goals of the
model was to be design-agnostic. In the future, another fuel form or coolant could be used
with this workflow to replicate a mass optimization on a new design. To this
end, homogeneous approximations were used to model the fuel, coolant, and
cladding.

\subsection{Homogeneous Reactivity Models}
The \keff response to the three modeled parameters was generated on a grid using
MCNP6.1 models. The models were homogeneous geometries consisting of
a core region (fuel, cladding, and coolant), a reflector region (graphite), a
pressure vessel (SS-304), and finally the surronding Martian regolith. The top of the
reflector was buried 1 m below the surface of the Martian regolith. Figure
\ref{fig:homog_model} shows an example reactor geometry.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Example reactor MCNP6.1 model.}
\label{fig:homog_model}
\end{figure}

The reactor and surronding Martian soil was modeled in a sphere. Vaccuum
boundary conditions were imposed on the edge of the sphere. The radius of the
sphere was set sufficiently large so that escaping neutrons would be unlikely to
return to the reactor.

Every \keff calculation was performed at room temperature. Neutron absorption
due to doppler broadening in \urantwo was assumed negligible due to high enrichment.
A higher energy spectrum due to no moderation also increase the resonance escape 
probability. In addition the purpose of the modeling was to create a
reduced-order model for reactivity, in the future the excess reactivity target
could be adjusted to account for reactivity feedback effects.

\subsection{Excess Reactivity Margin}
As discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:sweeps}, EOL \keff was weakly dependent on
thermal power. This meant that EOL \keff could be modeled as BOL \keff with
sufficient excess reactivity to account for depletion. With a target BOL reactivity,
depletion neutronics could be replaced by simple \keff calculations. This
was important because traditional depletion tools were too computationally
expensive to explore the desired reactor parameter space. Excess reactivity was
chosen based on the reactivity change in each of the 3901 depletion calculations. Figure
\ref{fig:delta_k_eol} shows the reactivity swing $(\Delta k$) for every core
with 100 kg < core mass < 500 kg. These mass bounds were chosen by initial thermal analysis
showing the reactor design would fall in this mass domain.

\caption{Reactivity swing over reactor lifetime}
\label{fig:delta_k_eol}
\end{figure}

A BOL \keff of 1.01 was deemed sufficient to sustain the fission chain reaction
through 10 years of full-power operation.

\section{Modeling \keff in 3D Parameter Space}\label{sec:crit_model}
This section discusses the methods used to derive a relationship between \keff,
core radius, fuel fraction and, reflector multiplier. The following method 
is discussed for the \uox-\codiox reactor configuration. The workflow was 
eventually applied to all four reactor designs (see Appendix \ref{ch:appendix-a}.

\subsection{BOL Reactivity Modeling}
Three predictor variables were explored to model BOL \keff: core radius,
fuel fraction, and reflector mulitplier. The reflector multiplier was used to
define the radius of the reflector as a function of core radius. Equation
\ref{eq:ref_mult} shows the reflector radius as a function of core radius and
reflector multiplier.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ref_mult}
    R_{refl} = mR_{core}
\end{equation}

Increasing the core radius added more fuel mass and decreases neutron leakage 
from the core. Increasing fuel fraction also increased fuel mass, which
increased absorption cross sections in the fuel and reduced leakage from the core.
Finally, adding reflector thickness prevented neutrons from leaking from the
core. A 3-dimensional grid of sampling data was generated to model each
predictor's impact on \keff. For each point in 3D (radius, frac, multiplier) 
space, a \keff calculation was performed using MCNP6.1.

\subsection{Parameter Ranges}
Initial scoping calculations were performed to determine appropriate ranges for
each of the three parameters (radius, frac, and multiplier). After the scoping,
9900 kcode calculations were run on a grid, evenly sampling in each dimension.
Table \ref{tab:bol_criticality_1000} shows the sampled domain for the initial
scoping calculation.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \caption{Criticality Sampling Domain}
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
     Parameter               & Range          & Samples\\ 
    \midrule                                  
     Core Radius             & 10 - 50 [cm]   & 30 \\
     Fuel Fraction 		     & 0.1 - 0.95 [-] & 10 \\
     Reflector Multiplier    & 0.001- 0.12 [-] & 33 \\
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:bol_criticality_1000}
\end{table}

Each of the 9900 data points were used to generate a \keff response over a 3D
domain of core radius, fuel fraction, and reflector multiplier.

\subsection{Reactivity Interpolation in 3D Space}
Linear interpolation was used to create a function for \keff to
constrain the core geometry. SciPy's 'RegularGridInterpolator' package was used
to interpolate the data. This function used the grid data
generated in Section \ref{sec:crit_rad_search} to return \keff as a function of
r, f, and m. Trilinear interpolation was used to estimate the \keff response.
Trilinear interpolation performs a linear combination of the 8 nearest points in
a cube surronding the desired point of interpolation. Linear interpolation is
only continuous to the zeroth derivative, but for large data sets, provides a
fast-executing function to model \keff.

Scipy's grid interpolator can be stored as a Python object and rapidly executed like any
function, making it useful as the target function for an
optimization. Despite numerous pratical advantages for using a trilinear
interpolator, there was systemic error introduced into the optimization by
representing nonlinear curves as piecewise-linear functions. The grid
interpolator was tested in order to understand the error. A testing set of data 
was generated with Latin Hypercube Sampling in the same 
domain space as the data used to train the interpolator. LHS ensured that every
point would check the interpolator with data that did not come directly from
the grid. For each \keff result in the
testing data, an interpolated result was generated using the interpolation
function. The absolute error was calculated
between each test \keff and its corresponding interpolated \keff. Figure
\ref{fig:interp_check} shows the distribution of the absolute error. Trilinear
interpolation was an adequate model for reactivity.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=4in]{../images/check_interp.png}
\caption{Reactivity discrepancy between interpolated and sampled data.}
\label{fig:interp_check}
\end{figure}

\section{Constrained Critical Mass Optimization}\label{sec:crit_rad_search}
A relationship between \keff and the three input
parameters (r, f, m) was developed, such that:

\begin{equation}
    k_{eff} = k(r, f, m)
\label{eq:gen_keff}
\end{equation}

Where $r$ was core radius, $f$ was fuel fraction, and $m$ was reflector multiplier. This
function was used to constrain the models to the required \keff target and
minimize the total critical reactor mass.


\subsection{Critical Core Radius}
Core radius was used as the free variable to meet the \keff constraint target. For
a given fuel fraction and reflector multiplier, a core radius exists that meets
the target \keff. At the heart of this workflow was Equation \ref{eq:gen_keff},
and its representation as a trilinear interpolation function. This function was
used to interrogate the \keff response to varying core radii at fixed fuel
fractions and reflector multipliers. SciPy's 'minimize\_scalar' function was used to
perform this search. The goal of the search was to minimize the absolute error
between the interpolated \keff and the target \keff (k$_0$ = 1.01).

\begin{equation}
    min( (k(r, f, m) - k_0)^2 )
    \label{eq:crit_rad}
\end{equation}

For a fixed fuel fraction and reflector multiplier, 'minimize\_scalar' performed a
bounded optimization to return a valid core radius to meet the target \keff.
This constraint was used in the next section to optimize the reactor mass.

\subsubsection{Critical Mass Optimization}
With a routine in place to constrain core radius to a target \keff, an
optimization to minimize mass was performed. Reflector multiplier (m) was used 
as the free variable to optimize overall core mass. 

Reflectors impact neutronics by reflecting neutrons back into the core. This
reflection reduces leakage and improves the neutron economy, as a result,
reflected cores require less fuel mass than bare cores. Increasing the
thickness of the reflector helps to a point, but eventually adding more reflector
thickness does not improve neutronic performance. Neutron leakage of course, is only
one part of the neutron life cycle. There are diminishing neutronic returns to
reflector thickness and increasing the reflector thickness increases the overall
reactor mass. The tradeoff between reflector mass and fuel mass was explored with 
the objective of minimizing total reactor mass. 

A constrained mass optimization was performed for reflector thickness using the
critical core radius constraint. For each fixed fuel fraction, a set of 20 multipliers was
checked from 0 to 0.12. Equation \ref{eq:crit_rad} returned a critical radius for
each combination of fuel fraction and reflector multiplier. This critical radius
was combined with fuel fraction and reflector multilplier to define the critical
core mass. The critical core mass included the mass of the fuel, coolant, cladding, 
reflector, and pressure vessel.

\begin{equation}
    M_{total} = f(r, f, m)
\end{equation}

The total mass (fuel, reflector, pressure vessel) for each critical
reactor was fitted against the reflector multipliers with a 2nd degree
polynomial. This polynomial was used as a target function for SciPy's
'minimize\_scalar' to minimize the core mass in reflector multiplier space.

\begin{equation}
    min( M_{total}(r, f, m) )
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Critical Mass Optimization Results}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=4in]{../images/mass_mult_064.png}
\caption{Total reactor mass optimization for fuel fraction of 0.64}
\label{fig:mass_mult_one}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mass_mult_one} shows the result of this optimization for one
fuel fraction, 0.64 for the UO2-CO2 reactor configuration. An important takeaway 
here, is the lack of curvature in this plot. The reactor mass for this 
configuration was relatively insensitive to reflector thickness. When compared to 
the total power cycle mass (on the order of 1000 kg), the 2 kg difference in reactor 
mass was deemed insignificant. This relative insensitivity to reflector mass was due
to the HEU fuel providing a much stronger absorption cross section, 
resulting in less neutron leakage from the core. In addition to strong fuel absorption, 
the reactor was buried in the Martian regolith, some reflection was be expected from 
the soil around the reactor which reduced the impact of the added reflector.
The standard deviation of the critical masses across reflector multiplier space
further suggested that reflector thickness was unimportant for the mass
optimization. The standard deviation of the mass ($m$) was calculated across $N$
multipliers for each fuel fraction.

\begin{equation}
    s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{N}(m_i - \bar{m})^2 }{N}}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=4in]{../images/mass_std_uo2_co2.png}
\caption{Standard deviation of reactor mass in reflector multiplier space}
\label{fig:mass_std_co2_uo2}
\end{figure}

The standard deviation of the mass across the range of tested reflector
multipliers was very small relative to the mass of the overall power cycle,
which was on the order of 1000 kg. As a result, the reflector multiplier was fixed to an
average value of 0.102 for the \uox-\codiox configuration. 
This average value was used to generate a critical radius
curve as a function of fuel fraction. 

\subsubsection{Choosing a fitting function for critical core radius}
The reactor mass model needed a functional relationship between fuel fraction
and critical core radius to constrain the core geometry for the thermal
hydraulic model. This was achieved with polynomial curve fitting.
Equation \ref{eq:polyfit} describes the target polynomial for the critical
radius fits, where n is the degree of fit.

\begin{equation}
    R_{critical} = \sum_{i=0}^n A_if^i
    \label{eq:polyfit}
\end{equation}

The choice of order of the polynomial was very important to accurately represent the
critical core radius. Reactivity was very sensitive to small mass changes, as
a result, an underfitted polynomial could return reactor masses that do not
result in the target BOL \keff. A simple study was conducted to make an informed
choice for the degree of fit. The study swept orders of polynomials from 2 to 9.
For each order, the reactor mass model was used to generate an optimized reactor
design. The parameters of each core were modeled with MCNP6.1 to verify the
reactivity of the design. This was done for both the \uox-\codiox and
the UW-\codiox reactor configurations. Figure \ref{fig:fit_order_test} shows the
result of this study.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=4in]{../images/poly_order_test.png}
\caption{Testing critical radius fit polynomials.}
\label{fig:fit_order_test}
\end{figure}

Polynomials less than 4th order were clearly underfitted and misrepresented the
critical radius relationship. A 7th degree polynomial was chosen to represent the
data. Figure \ref{fig:core_r_co2_uo2} shows the fitted curve and the
data generated by the critical radius algorithm and the underlying 3D
interpolation function.

\section{Summary}
A critical radius constraint was developed to constrain the geometry 
for thermal hydraulic portion of the reactor mass model. Core radius 
was constrained  to meet a target \keff as a function of
fuel fraction. Reflector thickness multiplier was used to minimize 
the total mass of a critical reactor. The optimized multipliers were 
found to be constant as a function of fuel
fraction and were modeled as such. Data was generated to represent critical core
radii as a function of fuel fraction. These data were fit to a 7th
degree polynomial that was used by the thermal hydraulic model to constrain the
core radius. The implementation of this constraint will be discussed in Chapter
\ref{ch:mass_model}.
