\section{Previous Space Reactor Work}
Using nuclear technology to power space systems is not a new concept. Various
space programs have been using nuclear technology for decades to power
statellites and deep space probes.

\subsection{Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators}

\subsection{SP-100}

\subsection{Kilopower}
The Kilopower reactor is a near-term reactor prototype under development at Los
Alamos National Laboratory. The reactor was designed to achieve Technical
Readiness Level 5 by 2017 \citep{MCNP_citation}

\subsection{Fission Concepts}

\subsection { Nuclear Thermal Propulsion }

Nuclear thermal propulsion is a promising alternative to chemical rockets for
deep space missions. Nuclear thermal rockets improve the efficiency of
traditional chemical rockets to drastically decrease the travel time to planets
in the solar system.
