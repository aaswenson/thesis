	abstract = {Dynamic fuel cycle simulation tools calculate nuclei inventories and mass flows evolution in an entire fuel cycle, from the mine to the final disposal. Usually, the fuel depletion in reactor is handled by a fuel loading model and a mean cross section predictor. In the case of a {PWR}–{MOX}, a fuel loading model provides from a plutonium stock the plutonium fraction in the fresh fuel needed to reach a specific burnup. A mean cross section predictor aims to assess isotopic cross sections required for building Bateman equations for any fresh fuel composition with a sufficient accuracy and a reasonable computing time. This paper presents a methodology based on neural networks for building a fuel loading model and a cross section predictor for a {PWR} reactor loaded with {MOX} fuel. The mean error of the plutonium content prediction from the fuel loading model is 0.37\%. Furthermore, the mean cross section predictor allows completion of the fuel depletion calculation in less than one minute with excellent accuracy. A maximum deviation of 3\% on main nuclei is obtained at the end of cycle between inventories calculated from neural networks and from the reference coupled neutron transport/fuel depletion calculation.},

Reactor power systems for planetary surface outposts and bases were evaluated from 10 to 500 kilowatts. Finally, reactor power systems in the range from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts were assessed for advanced propulsion applications. The analysis also examined the effect of advanced component technology on system performance. The advanced technologies included high temperature materials, lightweight radiators, and high voltage power management and distribution.},

	abstract = {The development of NASA’s Kilopower fission reactor is taking large strides toward flight development with several successful tests completed during its technology demonstration trials. The Kilopower reactors are designed to provide 1-10 kW of electrical power to a spacecraft or lander, which could be used for additional science instruments, the ability to power electric propulsion systems, or support human exploration on another planet. Power rich nuclear missions have been excluded from NASA mission proposals because of the lack of radioisotope fuel and the absence of a flight qualified fission system. NASA has partnered with the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration to develop the Kilopower reactor using existing facilities and infrastructure and determine if the reactor design is suitable for flight development. The threeyear Kilopower project started in 2015 with a challenging goal of building and testing a full-scale flight-prototypic nuclear reactor by the end of 2017. Initially, the power system will undergo several non-nuclear tests using an electrical heat source and a depleted uranium core to verify the complete nonnuclear system design prior to any nuclear testing. After successful completion of the depleted uranium test, the system will be shipped to the Nevada National Security Site where it will be fueled with the highly enriched uranium core and retested using the nuclear heat source. At completion of the project, NASA will have a significant sum of experimental data with a flight-prototypic fission power system, greatly reducing the technical and programmatic risks associated with further flight development. To compliment the hardware rich development progress, a review of several higher power mission studies are included to emphasize the impact of having a flight qualified fission reactor. The studies cover several science missions that offer nuclear electric propulsion with the reactor supplying power to the spacecraft's propulsion system and the science instruments, enabling a new class of outer planet missions. A solar versus nuclear trade for Mars surface power is also reviewed to compare the advantages of each system in support of ascent vehicle propellant production and human expeditions. These mission studies offer insight into some of the benefits that fission power has to offer but still lacks a wider audience of influence. For example, mission directorates won't include a fission power system in their solicitations until it's flight qualified, and scientists won’t propose new missions that require more power than what’s currently proven and available. An attempt to break this chicken and egg effect has been ongoing with the Kilopower project with the goal of advancing the technology to a level that encourages a flight development program and allows scientists to propose new ideas for higher power missions.},

@article{LHS,
	title = {Random {Search} for {Hyper}-{Parameter} {Optimization}},
	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efﬁcient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to conﬁgure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks conﬁgured by a pure grid search, we ﬁnd that random search over the same domain is able to ﬁnd models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search ﬁnds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising conﬁguration space. Compared with deep belief networks conﬁgured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional conﬁguration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for conﬁguring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},
